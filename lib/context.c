/**
 * gss_init_sec_context:
 * @minor_status: (integer, modify) Mechanism specific status code.
 * @initiator_cred_handle: (gss_cred_id_t, read, optional) Handle for
 *   credentials claimed.  Supply GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to act as a
 *   default initiator principal.  If no default initiator is defined,
 *   the function will return GSS_S_NO_CRED.
 * @context_handle: (gss_ctx_id_t, read/modify) Context handle for new
 *   context.  Supply GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for first call; use value
 *   returned by first call in continuation calls.  Resources
 *   associated with this context-handle must be released by the
 *   application after use with a call to gss_delete_sec_context().
 * @target_name: (gss_name_t, read) Name of target.
 * @mech_type: (OID, read, optional) Object ID of desired
 *   mechanism. Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain an implementation
 *   specific default.
 * @req_flags: (bit-mask, read) Contains various independent flags,
 *   each of which requests that the context support a specific
 *   service option.  Symbolic names are provided for each flag, and
 *   the symbolic names corresponding to the required flags should be
 *   logically-ORed together to form the bit-mask value.  See below
 *   for the flags.
 * @time_req: (Integer, read, optional) Desired number of seconds for
 *   which context should remain valid.  Supply 0 to request a default
 *   validity period.
 * @input_chan_bindings: (channel bindings, read, optional)
 *   Application-specified bindings.  Allows application to securely
 *   bind channel identification information to the security context.
 *   Specify GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS if channel bindings are not
 *   used.
 * @input_token: (buffer, opaque, read, optional) Token received from
 *   peer application.  Supply GSS_C_NO_BUFFER, or a pointer to a
 *   buffer containing the value GSS_C_EMPTY_BUFFER on initial call.
 * @actual_mech_type: (OID, modify, optional) Actual mechanism used.
 *   The OID returned via this parameter will be a pointer to static
 *   storage that should be treated as read-only; In particular the
 *   application should not attempt to free it.  Specify NULL if not
 *   required.
 * @output_token: (buffer, opaque, modify) Token to be sent to peer
 *   application.  If the length field of the returned buffer is zero,
 *   no token need be sent to the peer application.  Storage
 *   associated with this buffer must be freed by the application
 *   after use with a call to gss_release_buffer().
 * @ret_flags: (bit-mask, modify, optional) Contains various
 *   independent flags, each of which indicates that the context
 *   supports a specific service option.  Specify NULL if not
 *   required.  Symbolic names are provided for each flag, and the
 *   symbolic names corresponding to the required flags should be
 *   logically-ANDed with the ret_flags value to test whether a given
 *   option is supported by the context.  See below for the flags.
 * @time_rec: (Integer, modify, optional) Number of seconds for which
 *   the context will remain valid. If the implementation does not
 *   support context expiration, the value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be
 *   returned.  Specify NULL if not required.
 *
 * Initiates the establishment of a security context between the
 * application and a remote peer.  Initially, the input_token
 * parameter should be specified either as GSS_C_NO_BUFFER, or as a
 * pointer to a gss_buffer_desc object whose length field contains the
 * value zero.  The routine may return a output_token which should be
 * transferred to the peer application, where the peer application
 * will present it to gss_accept_sec_context.  If no token need be
 * sent, gss_init_sec_context will indicate this by setting the length
 * field of the output_token argument to zero. To complete the context
 * establishment, one or more reply tokens may be required from the
 * peer application; if so, gss_init_sec_context will return a status
 * containing the supplementary information bit GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
 * In this case, gss_init_sec_context should be called again when the
 * reply token is received from the peer application, passing the
 * reply token to gss_init_sec_context via the input_token parameters.
 *
 * Portable applications should be constructed to use the token length
 * and return status to determine whether a token needs to be sent or
 * waited for.  Thus a typical portable caller should always invoke
 * gss_init_sec_context within a loop:
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * int context_established = 0;
 * gss_ctx_id_t context_hdl = GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT;
 *        ...
 * input_token->length = 0;
 *
 * while (!context_established) {
 *   maj_stat = gss_init_sec_context(&min_stat,
 *                                   cred_hdl,
 *                                   &context_hdl,

 *                                   output_token,
 *                                   &actual_services,
 *                                   &actual_time);
 *   if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
 *     report_error(maj_stat, min_stat);
 *   };
 *
 *   if (output_token->length != 0) {
 *     send_token_to_peer(output_token);
 *     gss_release_buffer(&min_stat, output_token)
 *   };
 *   if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
 *
 *     if (context_hdl != GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT)
 *       gss_delete_sec_context(&min_stat,
 *                              &context_hdl,
 *                              GSS_C_NO_BUFFER);
 *     break;
 *   };
 *
 *   if (maj_stat & GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED) {
 *     receive_token_from_peer(input_token);
 *   } else {
 *     context_established = 1;
 *   };
 * };
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Whenever the routine returns a major status that includes the value
 * GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the context is not fully established and the
 * following restrictions apply to the output parameters:
 *
 * - The value returned via the time_rec parameter is undefined unless
 * the accompanying ret_flags parameter contains the bit
 * GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG, indicating that per-message services may be
 * applied in advance of a successful completion status, the value
 * returned via the actual_mech_type parameter is undefined until the
 * routine returns a major status value of GSS_S_COMPLETE.
 *
 * - The values of the GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG, GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG,
 * GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG, GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG, GSS_C_CONF_FLAG,
 * GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned via the
 * ret_flags parameter should contain the values that the
 * implementation expects would be valid if context establishment were
 * to succeed.  In particular, if the application has requested a
 * service such as delegation or anonymous authentication via the
 * req_flags argument, and such a service is unavailable from the
 * underlying mechanism, gss_init_sec_context should generate a token
 * that will not provide the service, and indicate via the ret_flags
 * argument that the service will not be supported.  The application
 * may choose to abort the context establishment by calling
 * gss_delete_sec_context (if it cannot continue in the absence of the
 * service), or it may choose to transmit the token and continue
 * context establishment (if the service was merely desired but not
 * mandatory).
 *
 * - The values of the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG and GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits
 * within ret_flags should indicate the actual state at the time
 * gss_init_sec_context returns, whether or not the context is fully
 * established.
 *
 * - GSS-API implementations that support per-message protection are
 * encouraged to set the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG in the final ret_flags
 * returned to a caller (i.e. when accompanied by a GSS_S_COMPLETE
 * status code).  However, applications should not rely on this
 * behavior as the flag was not defined in Version 1 of the GSS-API.
 * Instead, applications should determine what per-message services
 * are available after a successful context establishment according to
 * the GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.
 *
 * - All other bits within the ret_flags argument should be set to
 * zero.
 *
 * If the initial call of gss_init_sec_context() fails, the
 * implementation should not create a context object, and should leave
 * the value of the context_handle parameter set to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT
 * to indicate this.  In the event of a failure on a subsequent call,
 * the implementation is permitted to delete the "half-built" security
 * context (in which case it should set the context_handle parameter
 * to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT), but the preferred behavior is to leave the
 * security context untouched for the application to delete (using
 * gss_delete_sec_context).
 *
 * During context establishment, the informational status bits
 * GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN and GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN indicate fatal errors,
 * and GSS-API mechanisms should always return them in association
 * with a routine error of GSS_S_FAILURE.  This requirement for
 * pairing did not exist in version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so
 * applications that wish to run over version 1 implementations must
 * special-case these codes.
 *
 * The `req_flags` values:
 *
 * `GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG`::
 * - True - Delegate credentials to remote peer.

 * - False - replayed messages will not be detected.
 *
 * `GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG`::

 *
 * Return value:

 * @context_handle: (gss_ctx_id_t, read/modify) Context handle for new

 *   accept the context as a default principal.  If
 *   GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified, but no default acceptor
 *   principal is defined, GSS_S_NO_CRED will be returned.
 * @input_token_buffer: (buffer, opaque, read) Token obtained from

 * @input_chan_bindings: (channel bindings, read, optional)
 *   Application- specified bindings.  Allows application to securely

 * @src_name: (gss_name_t, modify, optional) Authenticated name of
 *   context initiator.  After use, this name should be deallocated by
 *   passing it to gss_release_name().  If not required, specify NULL.
 * @mech_type: (Object ID, modify, optional) Security mechanism used.
 *   The returned OID value will be a pointer into static storage, and
 *   should be treated as read-only by the caller (in particular, it

 * @delegated_cred_handle: (gss_cred_id_t, modify, optional
 *   credential) Handle for credentials received from context
 *   initiator.  Only valid if deleg_flag in ret_flags is true, in
 *   which case an explicit credential handle (i.e. not
 *   GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL) will be returned; if deleg_flag is false,

 * applied in advance of a successful completion status, the value
 * returned via the mech_type parameter may be undefined until the
 * routine returns a major status value of GSS_S_COMPLETE.
 *
 * The values of the GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG,
 * GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG,GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG, GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG,
 * GSS_C_CONF_FLAG,GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned
 * via the ret_flags parameter should contain the values that the
 * implementation expects would be valid if context establishment were
 * to succeed.
 *
 * The values of the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG and GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits
 * within ret_flags should indicate the actual state at the time
 * gss_accept_sec_context returns, whether or not the context is fully
 * established.
 *
 * Although this requires that GSS-API implementations set the
 * GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG in the final ret_flags returned to a caller
 * (i.e. when accompanied by a GSS_S_COMPLETE status code), applications
 * should not rely on this behavior as the flag was not defined in
 * Version 1 of the GSS-API. Instead, applications should be prepared to
 * use per-message services after a successful context establishment,
 * according to the GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.
 *
 * All other bits within the ret_flags argument should be set to zero.
 * While the routine returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the values returned
 * via the ret_flags argument indicate the services that the
 * implementation expects to be available from the established context.
 *
 * If the initial call of gss_accept_sec_context() fails, the
 * implementation should not create a context object, and should leave
 * the value of the context_handle parameter set to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT to
 * indicate this.  In the event of a failure on a subsequent call, the
 * implementation is permitted to delete the "half-built" security
 * context (in which case it should set the context_handle parameter to
 * GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT), but the preferred behavior is to leave the
 * security context (and the context_handle parameter) untouched for the
 * application to delete (using gss_delete_sec_context).
 *
 * During context establishment, the informational status bits
 * GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN and GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN indicate fatal errors, and
 * GSS-API mechanisms should always return them in association with a
 * routine error of GSS_S_FAILURE.  This requirement for pairing did not
 * exist in version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so applications that
 * wish to run over version 1 implementations must special-case these
 * codes.
 *
 * The `ret_flags` values:
 *

 * authentication and integrity services only.
 *
 * `GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG`::
 * - True - Integrity service may be invoked by calling either
 * gss_get_mic or gss_wrap routines.
 * - False - Per-message integrity service unavailable.
 *
 * `GSS_C_ANON_FLAG`::
 * - True - The initiator does not wish to be authenticated; the

 * name.
 * - False - The initiator has been authenticated normally.
 *
 * `GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG`::
 * - True - Protection services (as specified by the states of the
 * GSS_C_CONF_FLAG and GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) are available if the
 * accompanying major status return value is either GSS_S_COMPLETE or
 * GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
 * - False - Protection services (as specified by the states of the
 * GSS_C_CONF_FLAG and GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG) are available only if the

 *
 * Provided to support the sharing of work between multiple processes.
 * This routine will typically be used by the context-acceptor, in an

 * requests and accepts security contexts over them, then passes the
 * established context to one or more other processes for message
 * exchange. gss_export_sec_context() deactivates the security context
 * for the calling process and creates an interprocess token which,
 * when passed to gss_import_sec_context in another process, will
 * re-activate the context in the second process. Only a single
 * instantiation of a given context may be active at any one time; a
 * subsequent attempt by a context exporter to access the exported
 * security context will fail.
 *
 * The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the
 * interprocess token may be imported, either as a function of local
 * security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.  For
 * example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed
 * only between processes that run under the same account, or which

 *
 * The interprocess token may contain security-sensitive information
 * (for example cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged
 * to either avoid placing such sensitive information within
 * interprocess tokens, or to encrypt the token before returning it to
 * the application, in a typical object-library GSS-API implementation
 * this may not be possible. Thus the application must take care to
 * protect the interprocess token, and ensure that any process to
 * which the token is transferred is trustworthy.
 *
 * If creation of the interprocess token is successful, the
 * implementation shall deallocate all process-wide resources
 * associated with the security context, and set the context_handle to
